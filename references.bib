Man's actions amplify the impact of variability on hydroelectric power generation in two ways: Society adapts itself rapidly to transient beneficial conditions, creating a false sense of well-being; technology expands to consume maximum available resources, decreasing system resilience.},

Manual and telemetered measurements of spring snow-pack, corroborated by a physically based hydrologic model, are examined here for climate-driven fluctuations and trends during the period of 1916–2002. Much of the mountain West has experienced declines in spring snowpack, especially since midcentury, despite increases in winter precipitation in many places. Analysis and modeling show that climatic trends are the dominant factor, not changes in land use, forest canopy, or other factors. The largest decreases have occurred where winter temperatures are mild, especially in the Cascade Mountains and northern California. In most mountain ranges, relative declines grow from minimal at ridgetop to substantial at snow line. Taken together, these results emphasize that the West's snow resources are already declining as earth's climate warms.},

Planners are typically faced with a wide range of predicted changes from different models of unknown relative quality, owing to large but unquantified uncertainties in the modelling process. Here we report a systematic attempt to determine the range of climate changes consistent with these uncertainties, based on a 53-member ensemble of model versions constructed by varying model parameters. We estimate a probability density function for the sensitivity of climate to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and obtain a 5–95 per cent probability range of 2.4–5.4 °C. Our probability density function is constrained by objective estimates of the relative reliability of different model versions, the choice of model parameters that are varied and their uncertainty ranges, specified on the basis of expert advice. Our ensemble produces a range of regional changes much wider than indicated by traditional methods based on scaling the response patterns of an individual simulation.},

The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) was used as an indicator of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the PNA index as an indicator of the Pacific//North America pattern. These indices were correlated with surface climate data and split sample analyses were conducted to determine climate response during the extreme phases of each index. October–March precipitation was shown to be most strongly correlated with SOI averaged over the July–November period. The analysis showed that there are two centers of opposite association with the SOI. During low values of the SOI (ENSO events) precipitation is low in the Pacific northwest and high in the desert southwest. Correlations between SOI and temperature were greatest in the Pacific northwest. The split sample analysis also revealed statistically significant differences in precipitation occurring during extremes of the SOI. The PNA pattern was related to precipitation and temperature over a concurrent time period. Especially strong associations were noted in the Pacific northwest for both precipitation and temperature. Streamflow showed associations with SOI similar to precipitation.},

	abstract = {Water managers in the upper Klamath Basin, located in south-central Oregon and northeastern California, use forecasts of spring and summer streamflow to optimally allocate increasingly limited water supplies for various demands that include irrigation for agriculture, habitat for endangered fishes, and hydropower production. Flow forecasts are made by the Natural Resources Conservation Service using statistical models that use current snow and precipitation data collected at nearby monitoring sites as input. The forecasts for five upper Klamath Basin sites (Williamson River, Sprague River, Upper Klamath Lake, Gerber Reservoir, and Clear Lake Reservoir) are made at the beginning of each month from January through June.

In 2003, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the Bureau of Reclamation began a collaborative study to reduce uncertainty and error in seasonal flow forecasting in the upper Klamath Basin. The main objectives included (1) evaluating nonregression statistical modeling approaches, such as artificial neural networks, for their efficacy in reducing model error, (2) finding and evaluating potential model variables that better described long-term climate-trend conditions, and (3) analyzing the efficacy of upper Klamath Basin snow-water equivalent and precipitation data in forecast models.

The modeling approaches evaluated included principal components regression, nonautoregressive artificial neural networks, and autoregressive artificial neural networks. For the Upper Klamath Lake forecast site, the nonautoregressive artificial neural network models had lower error than the other models for the January, February, and March forecasts. However,the principal components regression model performed better for the April forecast. Both models performed roughly the same for the May and June forecasts. For the Sprague River forecast site, the nonautoregressive artificial neural network models performed far better than the other models for the January, February, March, and June forecasts. However, the principal components regression models performed better for the April and May forecasts.

For the Williamson River and Gerber Reservoir forecast sites, the principal components regression models generally, but not always, performed better than the other models. For the Clear Lake Reservoir forecast site, the nonautoregressive artificial neural network models performed far better than the other models for the months of January, February, and March. However, the Clear Lake Reservoir autoregressive artificial neural network model performed better than the other models for the month of April. For the Williamson River, Upper Klamath Lake, and Gerber Reservoir forecast models, the inclusion of new long-term climate-trend variables reduced model error in many, but not all, instances.

The relationships between the upper Klamath Basin snow-water equivalent, precipitation, and flow data were analyzed to determine the ability and the extent to which currentsnow-water equivalent and precipitation conditions can be used to forecast future flow conditions. The analyses were made by decomposing the flow time series into annual periodic, long-term climatic, and chaotic components, and then lag correlating the snow-water equivalent and precipitation time series with the chaotic component time series. After 120 days (approximately 4 months), all of the snow-water equivalent and precipitation correlation coefficients were less than 0.4.},

Analysis uncertainty occurs because of data errors and incomplete sampling over the historical period. This manuscript documents recent improvements in NOAA’s merged global surface temperature anomaly analysis, monthly, in spatial 5° grid boxes. These improvements allow better analysis of temperatures throughout the record, with the greatest improvements in the late nineteenth century and since 1985. Improvements in the late nineteenth century are due to improved tuning of the analysis methods. Beginning in 1985, improvements are due to the inclusion of bias-adjusted satellite data. The old analysis (version 2) was documented in 2005, and this improved analysis is called version 3.},

	abstract = {Climate change projections are often based on simulations from multiple global climate models and are presented as maps with some form of stippling or measure of robustness to indicate where different models agree on the projected anthropogenically forced changes. The criteria used to determine model agreement, however, often ignore the presence of natural internal variability. We demonstrate that this leads to misleading presentations of the degree of model consensus on the sign and magnitude of the change if the ratio of the signal from the externally forced change to internal variability is low. We present a simple alternative method of depicting multimodel projections which clearly separates lack of climate change signal from lack of model agreement by assessing the degree of consensus on the significance of the change as well as the sign of the change. Our results demonstrate that the common interpretation of lack of model agreement in precipitation projections is largely an artifact of the large noise from climate variability masking the signal, an issue exacerbated by performing analyses at the grid point scale. We argue that separating more clearly the case of lack of agreement from the case of lack of signal will add valuable information for stake-holders' decision making, since adaptation measures required in the two cases are potentially very different.},

This paper outlines the motivation for using multi-model ensembles, reviews the methodologies published so far and compares their results for regional temperature projections. The challenges in interpreting multi-model results, caused by the lack of verification of climate projections, the problem of model dependence, bias and tuning as well as the difficulty in making sense of an ‘ensemble of opportunity’, are discussed in detail.},

Spatial reconstructions of upper atmosphere pressure patterns and cool-season drought show that West Coast-wide drought, although relatively rare compared to north-south dipole drought, has occurred periodically since 1500 Common Era and is consistently associated with a strong ridge centered along the Pacific Northwest coast. Atmospheric blocking is also linked to north-dry dipole droughts, while south-dry and wider Western droughts indicate La Niña-type patterns. The transition latitude between the northern and southern sides of the western precipitation dipole, important for California hydroclimate patterns, has had frequent year-to-year fluctuations but remained centered on 40°N over the past five centuries.},

	abstract = {Warm and cold events in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific represent the two extreme climatic states of the Southern Oscillation and are related to pronounced winter climate anomalies along the Pacific coast of Anglo-America. Previous research has demonstrated that the Pacific/North American (PNA) pattern may be the typical response of the northern hemisphere winter atmosphere to tropical forcing during warm events. In general, the anomalous flow associated with the PNA pattern raises winter temperatures along the entire length of the Anglo-American west coast. Precipitation is enhanced in the vicinity of the Alaskan panhandle, but is suppressed to the south. During cold event winters, the dominant 700 mb anomaly strongly resembles the PNA pattern, but with a reversed polarity. Most cold event winters are associated with below normal temperatures along the west coast, while precipitation significantly decreases in the Alaskan panhandle and increases to the south. Thus, the climate anomalies experienced along the Anglo-American west coast during cold events are in the opposite sense to those of warm events.

Precipitation, and to a lesser extent temperature anomalies, are sensitive to minor fluctuations in the general placement and orientation of the PNA pattern, which in turn are related to shifts in the position of the polar front jet stream and associated storm track. Thus, a number of disparate climate anomalies are possible in the study area during warm event winters, depending upon the positioning of the long-wave pattern over the north Pacific and North America.

Although the PNA and ‘reverse PNA’ patterns can occur in any winter, they are significantly more frequent during warm and cold events, respectively, than in other winters. The west coast temperature and precipitation anomalies associated with the PNA (‘reverse PNA’) during warm event (cold event) winters can occur during any winter displaying the PNA (‘reverse PNA’) pattern, regardless of the presence of a warm (cold) event in the equatorial Pacific. A dynamical model is proposed to explain the observed teleconnection between the Anglo-American west coast and cold Southern Oscillation events.},
